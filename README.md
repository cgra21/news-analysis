# political-analysis
NLP Based Project for determining semantic using in political texts

This is a project which will analyze the semantics present in political writing, and how those semantics determine which political leaning the writing is recieved as.

It is designed to determine which parts of a political writing make it the political leaning it is.
For example, is the way an article talks about firearms and the second amendement deterministic to it's writers political leaning? How so? What other parts of the writing are similar to this?

# TODO 
- Determine most effective model for this use case
- Collect political writing samples from various political leanings
- Analyize the semantic nature of those writings
- Determine which parts of the writing make it which political leaning
- Build a tool to analyze new text and determine which parts of that text are which political leaning
